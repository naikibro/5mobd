# You must follow my conventionnal commits style

When asked to generate a commit, please always refer to the commitlint config

here is a model of a perfect commit:

```sh
git commit -am "feat(api) port Flights service and models

- created Flights service and store
- covered new service and store with unit tests
- imported all Types (models) from v1 app
- added Jest for Expo and setup
- added docs concerning the API fetching token mechanism"
```

- the commits comments lines shall start with list and minuscule letters
