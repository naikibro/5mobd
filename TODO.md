# TODO - COMPLETED ✅

- ✅ Fixed MyAddresses screen to only show user-created addresses and favorites
- ✅ Added ability to add public addresses to favorites with heart button
- ✅ MyAddresses screen now displays both created and favorite addresses
- ✅ **CREATED DEDICATED SERVICE AND HOOK** for MyAddresses page following module architecture
- ✅ Reused PhotoGallery and card UI components from Addresses page
- ✅ Ensured clean and minimal code with proper TypeScript types

## Summary of Changes:
